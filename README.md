## About
Task Manager is a simple to-do list app where you can add, track, and manage your tasks. You can set a due date, task duration, and mark tasks as "Done" or "Skipped". The app also lets you start all tasks at once and shows a summary of completed tasks.

## Features
- Add tasks with a name, due date, and duration.
- View all tasks and drag them to reorder.
- Mark tasks as "Complete" or "Skip".
- Start tasks based on their due time or start all at once.
- View a summary of completed tasks.
- Tasks are saved in your browser using local storage, so they stay even if you refresh the page.
